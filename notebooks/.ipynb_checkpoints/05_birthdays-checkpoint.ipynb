    "# Birthday Paradox Exercise\n",
    "This exercise comes from the [DSFM code-bank](https://github.com/dsfm-org/code-bank/blob/master/exercises/simulation-birthdays/simulation-birthdays.ipynb) repository of code. It has been replicated (and slightly adapted) here for ease of use in the Python workshop.\n",

    "Eventually you will learn many advanced Python tools -- such as numpy, scipy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and other specialized libraries. But even beginners can use pure Python to answer some very interesting questions. In this Exercise you will need to write a pure Python program to answer the following question.\n",

Some Python distributions such as Anaconda already come with a great deal of external libraries for scientific computing. It is also possible to install libraries using the `pip` command.\n",

    "#### Example: Plotting a Histogram\n",
    "The question asks us to give an answer \"on average\". You therefore should simulate many experiments. Any one experiment will give you just one example of what to expect, and it might be higher or lower than an answer \"on average\". Plot a histogram of your experimental results."
